Installation instructions:

        1) /bin/su to root

	2) Type "make" at the command line and determine your system type.

        3) Type "make <systype>"

        4) Type "make install" to install the binaries in their proper
           locations and set permissions properly.  (keyinit and keysh need
           to be setuid root)

        5) Create an emtpy /etc/skeykeys 
 
        6) chmod 644 /etc/skeykeys

You are now ready to have users run keyinit.  Please see keyinit documentation
on usage, etc.
